# Pentester-Academy-Interactor
Python3 script for bulk downloading and retrieving some information from Pentester Academy

Pentester Academy has a lot of courses, it is hard to review every one of them, so I made this script for getting some information and bulk downloading from it, also it will download videos from Youtube if they are available (so you can save some plays ;) ), notice that you have to have an active account to download videos from Pentester Academy.

Some options can run without having an account, but others will ask you to insert a valid cookie session. The script also works on Windows, but it doesn't add an extension to the videos downloaded from Youtube.

### renamer.sh
All the walktroughs of attackdefense labs are name like Walktrough-xxxx.pdf, it's very convenient for them, but makes difficult to know what contains each one of them if you have them stored, copy this script to the folder where you have store all the walktroughs, execute it and all of them will be renamed as the corresponding lab, please give it execution permission and use ./renamer.sh rather than using bash renamer.sh.
